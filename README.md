# Black-Swan-Trading-Thesis
Thesis material for UCL

There are numerous studies claiming that the markets do not follow the so called random walk hypothesis. In fact many market participants believe the markets are momentum trending or mean reverting. This thesis aims to further explore both of these behaviours and determine what process the S&P 500 follows. This thesis also evaluates a long/short equity trading strategy by investing in the top and bottom 10% of the stocks listed in the S&P 500 exploiting marketâ€™s reaction after unpredictable Black Swan events. This will also test the efficient market hypothesis and if beta is a valuable tool for portfolio selection. The active strategy yields a 91.2% increase while buying and holding the S&P 500 yielded 85.2% between 2007 and 2018. Other results include that neither the daily returns of the S&P 500 and the active strategy were represented by the normal distribution.
